# Change Log
All notable changes to the "electron-highlighter" extension will be documented in this file.

## 1.2.12
- Updates `.vscodeignore` to ignore unnecessary content when publishing the extension. This could cause the extension to be bloated with JS files we are only using for development.

## 1.2.11
- Fixes "Go to definition" highlighting (`editorLink.activeForeground`) color being transparent. This made text disappear when using `option + click` to navigate to a different file. It is now cyan and underlined.

## 1.2.10
- Make JavaScript component tags in HTML (like React, Vue, Svelte) use the same color tag as HTML tags

## 1.2.9
- Actually do the stuff from 1.2.8
- Fix the `publish` script so it actually rebuilds the theme before publishing... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ

## 1.2.8
- Explicitly set `tab.activeBorder` to the background color
- Change the base `variable` color from green to gray (not sure how/why it ever got set to green... sorry about that)

## 1.2.7
- Change `tab.activeBorder` to `tab.activeBorderTop`

## 1.2.6
- Minor UI updates, mostly around standardizing highlight colors for selection ranges

## 1.2.5
- Make vendored CSS property names the same color as normal property names
- Make CSS custom property ("variable") color red to match variable color in CSS preprocessors
- Updated CSS demo file with examples to showcase these changes

## 1.2.4
- Remove superfluous config for console class that is now covered by more generic `support.class`
- fix color on `support.class` (I intended for it to be yellow, not gray)

## 1.2.3
- More consistent highlighting of Classes

## 1.2.2
- set punctuation.accessor and keyword colors to purple. This affects things like optional chaining in JS and the `let` keyword in Rust
- remove a declaration causing JS variables to become green after the latest VSCode update

## 1.2.1
- Make `this` keyword red after last versions changes
