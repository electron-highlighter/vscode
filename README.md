Electron Highlighter Syntax is a dark UI and syntax theme for VS Code. This started as the official[1](#footnote) VS Code port of my [Electron Highlighter syntax theme for Atom](https://github.com/mikemcbride/electron-highlighter-syntax), but I have since switched to using VS Code as my main editor so it's no longer really a "port".

<p id="footnote">I hesitate to say my theme is popular enough to have an "official" port to another editor, but someone did make a theme and claim that it was a port of my Atom theme and frankly it was not great, so this is just to clarify that this is the _only_ extension that I'm endorsing as part of this little ecosystem of themes I've made.</p>
